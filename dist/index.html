                Willem Meyer here! I’m a professional programmer and amateur graphic designer. I’m about to complete my Masters of Software Engineering at the University of Western Australia. My final hurdle is the course’s practicum component which I will complete by interning at an organisation with a software focus. I hope to infiltrate such as organisation and make myself indispensable, learning all of their secrets so that once I am a qualified engineer they will have no choice but to keep me around. If you are part of such an organisation —either in Perth or abroad— please ignore the preceding line and email me!            </div>

                My masters coursework and research has afforded me the flexibility to pursue a specialisation in data driven computing. I’ve achieved intimate familiarity with every stage of data proceessing. From collection, cleaning and storage to analysis, visualisation and transformation. During my dissertation, I developed a complete data pipeline for looking into the future of automated assessment marking for free-form diagrams. I constructed a semantic segmentation model built around the U-net CNN architecture. I developed software for the processing of exam papers and developed tooling for the labelling and augmentation of images for supervised learning tasks, conducted ML experiments and analysed the results.

                My work in graphic design started as a hobby. When I was elected as publications office at University Hall. I was able to hone my skills producing promotional posters, shirts, logos, banners and multimedia. The role also saw me act as photographer, social media manager and marketing agent for the college’s Resident’s Club as we ran social, community and sporting events for the more than 700 residents.
                Owing to our successes at Unihall I was taken on as a graphic designer at Bloom UWA. Bloom provided support services, networking, education and office space to start-ups in the UWA community, and our team promoted these services and events as well as providing graphic design services to the start-ups themselves. As the marketing and communications teams grew, I became team lead in charge of a small team of designers and photographers. I was awarded Bloom’s Most Valued Person for my contribution.
